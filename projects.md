# 1. Bee Hive Monitor
<p class="larger-font">
This project focuses on the precise monitoring of hive weight and the temperature both inside and outside the hive.<br> 

This advanced monitoring system plays a crucial role in maintaining the health of the bees. <br>

By constantly tracking these parameters, we can detect early signs of stress in the hive.<br><br>

A key aspect of our system is the regulation and observation of the temperature in the bees' internal nursing area, which is maintained at a constant, optimal level.<br>

Any fluctuations in this temperature serve as an early warning of potential stress factors affecting the bee colony.<br>

Moreover, monitoring the hive weight provides valuable insights into the honey production rate, allowing for timely interventions to maximize yield.<br><br>

To facilitate real-time monitoring and rapid response, I've developed a mobile app. <br>

This app brings the critical data directly to the user, enabling efficient and effective hive management.<br>
